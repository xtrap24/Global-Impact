# Global-Impact
This is a whole new world for me. I have recently ventured into learning to code. I'm starting from zero so everything I doing right now is from knowing nothing at all. So far I have been able to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I'm also trying to find and connect to the community that is passionate and committed to the course. 

I have desire to do this kind of learning but never tried to take the plung until recently. I must say that there's a whole world outta there and I'm glad I did try. As I seek to expand my know how and understanding of the knowledge and the community in general I will calling out for some guidiance from those in the community. 

thank you
